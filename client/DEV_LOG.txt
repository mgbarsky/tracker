    EXPORT TO FILE: done
    icon of page
    colored tags

    metrics
    new metric - special fields

    metrictags
    new metric tag

    tag list: added checkbox (for safety) because the colors do not work on Chrome in production

    tracking tasks (activities) - elapsed time replaced with started so far

tracking mood -- special in-line css, and updating components (detached mode)?
//https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/input  defaultValue for input will detach it from state

EXPLORE:    
    handling date object properly
    make some elements not redraw

TBD:
    make possible enable/disable the entire group of tasks by tags (or maybe not)
    elapsed time
